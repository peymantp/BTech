here is our dear orthodox russian army thought bolkonski recalling
bilibins words

wishing to find out where the commanderinchief was he rode up to a
convoy directly opposite to him came a strange onehorse vehicle
evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and
looking like something between a cart a cabriolet and a caleche a
soldier was driving and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the
apron under the leather hood of the vehicle prince andrew rode up and
was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention was
diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle an
officer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was driving
the womans vehicle for trying to get ahead of others and the strokes
of his whip fell on the apron of the equipage the woman screamed
piercingly seeing prince andrew she leaned out from behind the apron
and waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl cried

mr aidedecamp mr aidedecamp for heavens sake protect me
what will become of us i am the wife of the doctor of the seventh
chasseurs they wont let us pass we are left behind and have lost
our people

ill flatten you into a pancake shouted the angry officer to the
soldier turn back with your slut

mr aidedecamp help me what does it all mean screamed the
doctors wife

kindly let this cart pass dont you see its a woman said prince
andrew riding up to the officer

the officer glanced at him and without replying turned again to the
soldier ill teach you to push on back

let them pass i tell you repeated prince andrew compressing his
lips

and who are you cried the officer turning on him with tipsy rage
who are you are you in command here eh i am commander here not you
go back or ill flatten you into a pancake repeated he this
expression evidently pleased him

that was a nice snub for the little aidedecamp came a voice from
behind

prince andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless tipsy
rage when a man does not know what he is saying he saw that his
championship of the doctors wife in her queer trap might expose him to
what he dreaded more than anything in the worldto ridicule but his
instinct urged him on before the officer finished his sentence prince
andrew his face distorted with fury rode up to him and raised his
riding whip
