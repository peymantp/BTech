Assignment # 3
```
Due: To be completed by February 14, 1700 hrs. This is an individual assignment.

Task:

- Your task is to design and implement a one-time pad cipher using bit manipulation.
- Your application will encrypt plaintext from a file specified by the user, and store the
    ciphertext in a file specified by the user.
- Alternatively, a user may select to read plain text from the keyboard and display the
    ciphertext only.
- Run the binary examples provided which illustrate the use of a one-time pad using a random
    key (otp), and a cipher that uses bit-manipulation to produce a string of completely
    unintelligible ciphertext (crypto).
- You will be combining these two techniques in your implementation.
- Constraints:

```
o It is required that the key generation for encryption be random.
o The bit-manipulation operator will be XOR.
o You may use any language of your choice.
o Your implementation should allow the user to specify whether the ciphertext will be
read from a file or from the keyboard.
o Your application must either prompt the user for the filenames, or specify them as
command line arguments.
o The ciphertext produced by your application must be completely unintelligible due to
the bit-mangling process.
```
