<p><em><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Discuss the following questions in your group, and present your conclusions to the class.</span></strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Describe a study you would be interested in conducting using a quantitative approach. Remember that in a quantitative study, you will collect and analyze numerical data to answer a specific research question about your topic. In planning your answer, first consider a general topic or issue of interest. Second, state your research question or hypothesis. Third, provide a general description of how you will design your study to answer the research question (i.e., your research methodology). Finally, describe how you will report your findings.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Describe a study you would be interested in conducting using a qualitative approach. Remember that in a qualitative study, you will probably want to start with a general research question rather than with a specific hypothesis. In planning your answer, first consider a general topic or issue of interest. Second, state your general research question. Third, provide a general description of how you will design your study to answer the research question (i.e., your research methodology). Finally, describe how you will report your findings.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Professor Parsnip wants to know more about the mental process students go through as they learn about research methods.&nbsp; She also wants to know which instructional methods are most effective for teaching research methods to her students.&nbsp; Assume that Professor Parsnip decides to take a quantitative approach to studying these questions.&nbsp; State a specific research question related to her general research problem that lends itself well to a quantitative research approach.&nbsp; Then explain why your question is better addressed using a quantitative, rather than a qualitative, methodology.</span></li>
<li><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Identify the type or types of validity that are reflected in each of the following statements.</span></em></li>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Items on a measurement instrument provide a representative sample of the content area, or domain, being measured.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Superficial qualities of the instrument can help ensure cooperation of people participating in a research study.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The scores on an intelligence test correlate with a measure of cognitive complexity.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A published intelligence test actually does measure intelligence.</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You are interested in finding out whether business-run childcare or independent childcare better prepares preschoolers for kindergarten. You choose only 5- year-old children entering kindergarten who have been in the same childcare arrangement for at least 6 months to participate. You measure the preparedness for kindergarten by using standard kindergarten entrance exam questions and kindergarten CTBS (a standardized test) scores given during the spring of the school year.</span></li>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">What is the research topic or question?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Is this qualitative or quantitative research?</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dr. Smithson has conducted a study comparing sleeping habits and work productivity of participants. He finds that participants who wake up no later than 6:00 a.m. are more productive workers than participants who wake up later than 6:00 a.m. In his conclusions, he asserts that people are more likely to be good workers if they wake up early rather than later.</span></li>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Are Dr. Smithson's conclusions warranted? Why or why not?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Describe two characteristics of early risers that might make them more productive than late risers.</span></li>
</ul>
