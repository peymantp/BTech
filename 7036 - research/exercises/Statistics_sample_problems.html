<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>COMP 7036 Statistics</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><b><i>Sample problems</i></b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><b>Example #1</b>: Based on a sample of 40 cars of a particular model, the fuel tank capacity is calculated for each. Based on this data, the sample mean is 18.92 gallons. The population standard deviation is to be 3.5. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean fuel capacity of this model of car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><i>Answer: (17.84,20.00)</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><b>Example #2</b>: Suppose that a sample of 100 light bulbs that a plant produces is chosen at random.&nbsp; In the sample, there are 6 defective bulbs.&nbsp; Obtain a 98% confidence interval for the proportion of defective bulbs they produce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><i>Answer: (0.0047,0.1152)</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><b>Example #3</b>: Dr. Pepper claims to put 12 fluid ounces of soda into every can with a standard deviation of <span lang="EL">&sigma;</span>=0.18. We suspect they are short changing us. So, we take a sample of 24 cans and measure the mean amount of soda in the cans. We find the mean amount of soda to be 11.92 fluid ounces. Is this enough evidence to suggest that Dr. Pepper is not being truthful?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><i>Answer: p=0.0146; yes there is enough evidence</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><b>Example #4</b>: Mountain Dew claims claims that Diet Mountain Dew Code Red has 40 mg of sodium per can.&nbsp; We work for a consumer organization that tests such claims.&nbsp; We take a random sample of 50 cans and find that the mean amount of sodium in the sample is 41.4 mg. The standard deviation in all cans is 7.2 mg. We suspect that there is more than 40 mg of sodium per can.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><i>Answer: p=0.0846; no there is not sufficient evidence</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><b>Example #5</b>: Let&rsquo;s suppose that grocery stores typically sell 3400 cans of Pepsi per week (with a standard deviation of 500 cans). Pepsi then begins a new marketing campaign complete with a new slogan and jingle. They are curious as to how the new advertising will affect sales (to see if sales increased or decreased). They sample 40 random store for a week and find that the mean number of cans the stores sell is 3550.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><i>Answer: p=0.0578; no there is not sufficient evidence</i></span></p>
