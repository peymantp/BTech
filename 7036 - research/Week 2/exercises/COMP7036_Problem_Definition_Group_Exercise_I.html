<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Why is it important that the researcher articulate, as clearly as possible, all assumptions that affect the research problem?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Your textbook authors recommend explicitly defining any term that might be misunderstood by someone reading the research proposal.&nbsp; If the research proposal is being written chiefly for use and review by researchers, why is such a step necessary?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Daphne has been a member of a research team studying interpersonal aggression among preschoolers for more than a year.&nbsp; In that time, her team has repeatedly employed a consistent set of techniques and procedures to study preschoolers as they interact in a number of settings.&nbsp; The procedures revolve around volunteer mothers bringing their children to the university child development lab for a &ldquo;play session&rdquo; that is the basis of the formal observations.&nbsp; Settings they have studied so far include: the university pre-school, affluent local day-care centers, and a pre-kindergarten program being offered in the neighborhood school district.&nbsp; All of these settings were fairly racially homogenous.&nbsp;Daphne has just learned that a friend of a friend can help her gain research access, in the near future, to preschoolers in an unusually racially diverse though impoverished preschool setting.&nbsp; Daphne decides she has no time to prepare a formal research proposal before embarking on the study.&nbsp; &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; she thinks, &ldquo;this study should go just like all the others we&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;&nbsp;Is Daphne leaving herself open to problems in this situation, or is she safe moving ahead with no formal proposal, given how familiar she is with the study techniques and procedures?</span></li>
