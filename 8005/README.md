 # Network and Security Applications Development
 ## Course Description:

This course is designed to provide students with a solid set of practical skills in the area of network and system-level programming on the Linux platform. The design and implementation of IPv4/IPv6 Client-Server applications is covered in- depth. Issues such as modularity and efficiency in the implementation of protocols will be covered. The emphasis will be very much the design and implementation of high-performance, robust, and scalable network applications. Security and private data transmission techniques over public networks are covered. Client-Server applications are designed and implemented using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) API. An in-depth coverage of techniques used to design and develop secure code and robust applications will be provided. Students will also be familiarized with the Bluetooth software development techniques. 

## Course Learning Outcomes/Competencies

1.  Implement advanced communications protocols on a multi-processing, multitasking environment.

2.  Use the IPV4 and IPv6 socket API calls in the design and implementation of networked applications.

1.  Design and implement Client-Server applications over a multi-platform network (e.g. Windows Clients to a UNIX Server).

2.  Use high-performance, edge-triggered system calls such as epoll to design and implement high-speed and high- load network applications.

3.  Use the Berkeley Sockets API proficiently, including multicasting and raw sockets.

4.  Design and implement secure applications using SSL.

5.  Design and implement basic Client/Server applications for Bluetooth devices.

6.  Use effective debugging techniques using tools such as gdb, gprof, valgrind, strace, ltrace, etc.
