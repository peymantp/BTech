Numbers symbols for counting
Use 0/1 to count lots of things
Binary number system

0010 0011
1 + 2 + 32 = 35
1*2^0 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^5 = 35

convert, no problem

add bit by bit
carry?  goes into the flag register.
toss or use?  depends

byte  8 bits
word  16 bits (2 bytes)
doubleword  32
quadword 64

4 bits map nicely to hexadecimal set of numbers (0-F)
16 of "items" "symbols" 

3BA4?
4*16^0 + 10*16^1 + 11*16^2 + 3*16^3 = 

Negatives Numbers
Two's complement representation
Easy to implement in hardware
Subtractions are just additions
Very magical
